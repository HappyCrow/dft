- add the CLI and send the Quit command to everybody

- before executing a command from the CLI, a DS or MDS
  should verify the signature of the command.
  only commands signed with the private key of the user
  who started DAFT should be executed

- think about the state module and delta of states
  - the MDS will do queries based on filenames

1) start
   - the MDS
   - then all DSs

2) quit
   - all DSs
   - then the MDS

3) put
   - a small file
   - a big file
   - a directory
