- refactor heavily into src/types.ml
- do a simple example using zeromq
- think seriously about the state module and delta of states
  - do ocaml sets remember the size of the set at anytime
    or is it computed on the fly?

1) start
   - the MDS
   - then all DSs

2) quit
   - all DSs
   - the MDS

3) put
   - a small file
   - a big file
   - a directory
