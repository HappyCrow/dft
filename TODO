TODO
====

- put incoming messages of the MDS into a priority queue
  - initial queue size is 3 times the number of DSs
  - state updating messages must be processed with a higher priority
    than executing commands
    - use ZMQ.Socket.has_more to know if we can read more messages
    - batch at most N messages before processing the state updates
      first. Process messages immediately if less than N are available

PERFORMANCE
===========

- we can cache chunks coming in when not in raw mode
  - so that we don't need to compress|sign|encrypt them once
    more in the future
  - or use a special send function to get a copy of what is sent
    on the wire: all broadcasting functions should use that

- interesting worst case to test:
  many hosts ask for the same small file at the same time
  (if there is no load balancing, then the system behaves badly)

SECURITY
========

PUBLIC RELATIONS
================

 - advertize first beta release on several mailing lists for
   computational scientists
   - caml-list
   - comp. chem. ML
   - open babel ML
   - CCP4 ML
   - linuxfr
