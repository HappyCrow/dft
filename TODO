TODO
====

- create CLI and send the Quit command to everybody

- MDS should know the DSs' pull sockets and have a corresponding
  push socket for each of them
- the DS should know the MDS' pull socket and have a corresponding
  push socket
  - it should also know the pull socket of all other DSs and have
    a corresponding push socket for each of them

(* Socket to receive messages on *)
let receiver = Socket.create context Socket.pull in
Socket.connect receiver "tcp://localhost:5557";

(* Socket to send messages to *)
let sender = Socket.create context Socket.push in
Socket.connect sender "tcp://localhost:5558";

COMMANDS SEMANTICS
==================

1) start
   - the MDS
   - then the MDS starts all DSs

2) quit
   - the MDS receives a quit command from the CLI
   - it send the quit command to all DSs
   - each DS quit upon reception of the quit command

3) put a file

4) put a directory
   TODO: recursive put file on all the content of the dir

SECURITY
========

- before executing a command from the CLI, a DS or MDS
  could verify the signature of the command.
  only commands signed with the private key of the user
  who started DAFT should be executed

- the MDS will do queries based on filenames
  - chunks should be stored in a data structure that is cheap to randomize
